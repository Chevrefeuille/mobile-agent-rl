# Mobile agent RL

## About

This project introduces a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) reinforcement learning environment for a mobile agent. The agent is a 2D object that interacts with a 2D environment. The agent can move in any direction and can sense the environment through a limited field of view. The environment contains a target object that the agent must find. The agent is rewarded for finding the target object.
